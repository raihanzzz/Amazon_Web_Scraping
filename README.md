# 📦 Amazon Web Scraping with Python: Product Data for Analysts

> _"Web scraping isn't just for developers. As a data analyst, knowing how to gather, clean, and structure real-world data is key—and that's exactly what this project delivers."_

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how a **Data Analyst** can leverage **Python web scraping** tools to extract meaningful product data directly from e-commerce platforms like **Amazon**. Using `BeautifulSoup` and `Requests`, I scraped product details (like title, price, rating, and availability) from Amazon listings of **T-shirts related to data analysts**.

Rather than relying on pre-cleaned datasets, I went straight to the source and built a custom scraper tailored to Amazon's HTML structure — a valuable skill for anyone in analytics or business intelligence.

## 📊 Data Collected

Each record includes:

- ✅ **Product Title**
- 💵 **Price**
- ⭐ **Rating**
- 💬 **Number of Reviews**
- 🚦 **Availability**
- 🌐 **URL of the Product**

This structured dataset can be used for:
- Pricing trend analysis
- Product comparison
- Sentiment approximation via ratings
- Competitive analysis

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Highlights

- 📌 **Dynamic Page Handling**: Tackled the challenges of JavaScript-heavy pages by working with static HTML copies for testing and future-proofing the scraper.
- 🔍 **Tag Parsing**: Carefully navigated Amazon’s nested HTML structure to extract consistent data even when certain elements (like pricing or ratings) were missing.
- 💡 **Edge Case Management**: Gracefully handled missing or inconsistent data (e.g., unavailable prices or out-of-stock items).
- 🧼 **Data Cleaning**: Converted raw scraped content into a clean, analysis-ready CSV format.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- 🕸️ Add real-time scraping capabilities using `Selenium` or `Playwright` to dynamically render JS.
- 🧠 Integrate NLP for **review sentiment analysis**.
- 📤 Add automated email alert if new products match certain keywords.
- 🌍 Deploy as a Flask/Django microservice for on-demand data.
